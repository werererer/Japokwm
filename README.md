"ðŸ˜« Tired of your window manager playing boss with your windows?

Japokwm is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that makes it a breeze to create custom layouts with a simple configuration. ðŸª„ You define where windows should be, and Japokwm handles the rest, so you can sit back and relax. ðŸ˜Œ"

## Known limitations and issues
With version 0.3 I consider this project to be in it's beta stage that means the focus is now on fixing bugs and less about adding new features. In this stage bugs still may occur but way less than in the alpha stage (If you find them please report them here)

## TODO
polish program and syntax for configuring

## Acknowledgements
japokwm forked dwl and uses wlroots and parts of sway to do the heavy lifting
